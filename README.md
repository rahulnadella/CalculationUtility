# CalculationUtility

##Overview

The CalculationUtility provides several functions to enable calculating of values easier. The CalculationUtility contains summation, product, factorial, min, max, squared, cubed, and overloaded +-*/ (which are not implicit casted). This utility can make your life with Swift easier when doing calculation between different type.

#####Note
>Swift currently has a type check and requires left and right operand of the same type. When using this utility you will lose type safety when using these operators, which is opposite to Swift design. But I find at almost all the time, you will know what you are doing with these numbers and the conversion will be just exactly what you want.

#####Version
>Version 1.0 -> Design and Implementation of the CalculationUtility 

#####Build
>Master -> Only works on iOS 8.0 or greater
